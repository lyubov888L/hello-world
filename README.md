Hi Humans !

Lyubov here, I like Russian language , micro and macro biology, anatomy, Google translator, travel, take family photos and get great reviews (it helps me to live and to identify myself and other people and learning other languages ​​and handwriting!).
I have a daughter Valerie, she is 10 years old, I have a medical education and contribute to the benefit of the future earthly world.
